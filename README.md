ArloWeb
=======

This is a web interface for my Arlobot robot.
![Screenshot](screenshot.png?raw=true "ArloWeb")
It requires both the ArloBot and the Metatron packages.

You will need a web server running on your robot for this to work. I use XAMPP.

Setup:
Edit arloweb.ini.example to match your machine and rename it to arloweb.ini
Either place this in your XAMPP path, or edit your XAMPP setup to point to this folder elsewhere.
