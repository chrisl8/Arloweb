Please see the [ArloBot Repository](https://github.com/chrisl8/ArloBot) instead.

This is only left here so that I can reference old code. Everything here is now moved to [ArloBot](https://github.com/chrisl8/ArloBot), and this will not function any longer.

This was a web interface for my Arlobot robot.
![Screenshot](screenshot.png?raw=true "ArloWeb")
It required both the ArloBot and the Metatron packages.

It required a seperate web server running on the robot to work. I used XAMPP at the time.  

Setup:  
Edit arloweb.ini.example to match your machine and rename it to arloweb.ini  
Either place this in your XAMPP path, or edit your XAMPP setup to point to this folder elsewhere.
